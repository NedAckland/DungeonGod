A RPG turn based stratagy game for discord. this project is made for fun and educational purposes.

firstly will be working on getting a basic outline of the game going. once we have an idea we can work on specifics and balancing the game. when we have a overview of how the characters will be built and developed we should work on the quest and story telling. eventually i want to impliment NLP to create an unlimited amount of scenarios.however for now i would like to make custom scenarios that we create also players have the option of creating their own, we should keep this in mind during developement so we scale the application in the right way.

my current idea for the classes is that the players will be leveling up in 5 different areas, 1-their main level, 2-attack, 3-defense, 4-magic and 5-craft.
as they level up their different attribute abilities specific to that attribute will become available for them. for example if someone reaches 20 attack they will get a special ability. for their main level their race will depend on the perks they will get.
some class's won't be able to get certain attribute points but will excel in other areas, this mechanic will encourage co-op gameplay.

for the different races im open to ideas.

for the scenarios, after we get a basic skeleton of how they are made, you can contribute any story you like.

guilds will be a thing later in the game they will work off respect points, the guilds will have strenght in numbers. for example a guild might start off with a cap of 5 members and need to expand their base with respect points to get more members. also guilds will get paid for having members. they will also have the ability to put out quests(can be custom quests) for their members to complete, this will earn the guild respect points. as well as this occasionally the guild will recieve random quests from the bot.
im open to ideas to expand the workings of the guild just don't get too complicated.
